(* Note: this version of the type-checker is somewhat weak with regard
   to slicing types (Bitslicing, Hslicing, Vslicing). A better version
   should perform direction and word-size inference. That being said,
   both the slicing type and word size are themselves somewhat
   limited: a slicing type can either be generic or be a speficic
   one. A better type-system should allow constraints on both the
   slicing and word-size (so that the user can express that an
   algorithm works on B/H-slicing but not Vslicing for instance). *)

(* Most function return something: this is actually to build an AST in
   which Consts are typed. In the future, it should also (probably)
   perform dir/m inference. *)

(* Note: to check for out-of-bounds access, and to be able to easily
   expand types, loops are simulated. For instance, to type everything
   inside `forall x in [1,5] { deqs }`, we type deqs with x=1, then
   x=2, etc up to x=5. It might have been cleaner to perform some
   symbolic execution instead, or to delay bound checking to later in
   the pipeline, but doing this for now. *)

(* Note: the term "array" in this modules design both types Array and
   Uint of size > 1. *)

(* About the variable |backtrace|: ideally, Ocaml would have an option
   to die gracefully with a backtrace. In pratice, this doesn't work
   well. To provide meaningfull error messages, we use a (local)
   variable called |backtrace| which we update upon entering a
   function.
   |backtrace| is maintained as a list of string representing the
   backtrace in reverse order (meaning that when printing it, the most
   recent calls appear first).  *)
