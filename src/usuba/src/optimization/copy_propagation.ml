                          copy_propagation.ml

   Copy propagation (abreviated CP throughout Usubac) is yet another
   very common optimization, which consists in eliminating unnecessary
   assignments. Typically,

      x = a + b;
      y = x;
      z = y + c;

   Becomes:

      x = a + b;
      z = x + c;

   Note that when this module runs, the only copy-assignments in the
   code are of primitive types (ie Uint(_,_,1)) since we are in
   Usuba0. (only function calls return multiple arguments, and are
   by definition not "copy-assignments")
   Assignments of Const to variables are also removed by this module
   whenever possible.

   A few things are slightly tricky:

   1\ Not eliminate copies to outputs.
   For instance:

      node f(a:b1) returns (b:b2)
      let
          x = a ^ b;
          b[0] = x;
          y = b[0] ^ 1
          b[1] = y;
      tel

   Should (obisouly) not become:

      node f(a:b1) returns (b:b2)
      let
          x = a ^ b;
          y = x ^ 1;
      tel

   But rather:

      node f(a:b1) returns (b:b2)
      let
          b[0] = a ^ b;
          b[1] = x ^ 1;
      tel


   2\ Not eliminate variables that are going to be used in loops.
   For instance, in the following code,

      x[0] = y;
      forall i in [1, 5] {
        x[i] = a + x[i-1];
      }

   `x[0] = y` should not be removed.


   3\ Not eliminate assignments to arrays that later used in function
   calls. For instance:

      x[0] = a;
      x[1] = b;
      ... = f(x);

   If the first two assignments are optimized away, things gets
   complicated in the call to |f|...


   All of those issues (1,2,3) are dealt with by computing a set
   (called |env_keep| throughout this module) of variables that must
   not be optimized away. This is an overapproximation, because in a
   case like:

     a:u2,b:u2
     b[0] = a[0];
     b[1] = a[1];
     ... = f(b)

   We will not optimized out `b` even though it could be an `f` could
   be called with `a` instead of `b`. TODO: fix.

   Furthermore, within loops, no arrays whatsoever are optimized out:

     node f(x,y:u2[2]) returns (z:u2[2])
        vars a,b,c,d,e:u2[2]
     let
         forall i in [0,1] {
           a[i] = x[i] ^ y[i];
           b[i] = a[i];
           c[i] = b[i];
           d[i] = f(c[i]);
           e[i] = d[i];
           z[i] = e[i]
         }
     tel

   Would not be optimized at all. TODO: fix.
