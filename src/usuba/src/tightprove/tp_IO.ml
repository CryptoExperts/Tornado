(* Returns two filenames:
    - a filename to store the source of |def|
    - a filename to store the _refreshed_ version of |def|.
  Basically, those files should be used as input and output to
  tightprove.
  Note that this function creates the directory of the files, but
  not the files themselves. (the point being that the caller can
  easily create the files should he need to, but doesn't have to
  bother create the directory, which would be trickier)

(* Search cache for |def| refreshed.

   The cache is fairly approximative for now: each def gets hashed,
   and a directory with its hash name is created. Collisions are _not_
   handled, meaning that if 2 defs have the same hash, then they will
   erase each other refreshed version each time we try to refresh
   them.

   TODO: A better way might be to use SHA256 hash (which we can safely
   consider uniq) instead. However, the question "what to hash?"
   remains. The answer is probably a textual representation of the
   node. To be future-proof though, we need to 1- settle on a
   representation, 2- normalize variable names *)
